# 🏭 Steel Plate Defect Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict defects in steel plates using multi-label classification techniques. The workflow covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The goal is to accurately identify different types of surface defects to support industrial quality control.
